# Dynamic-Sales-Performance-Tracker: Current vs Previous Year

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing year-over-year sales performance for **Hakoot**, an e-commerce website operating in the US. The **Dynamic Sales Performance Dashboard** was built using Excel to visualize and compare key metrics from 2021 and 2022, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Key Insights
- :white_check_mark: **Total Sales** for 2022 saw a significant increase of **21.33%**, surpassing 2021.
- :white_check_mark: **Total Profit** rose by **38.73%**, while **total quantity sold** increased by **25.76%** compared to the previous year.
- :white_check_mark: **Top Product Categories** (2022) change to **Technology (36%)**, **Office Supplies (33%)**, and **Furniture (31%)**.
- :white_check_mark: **Top States** contributing to 2022 sales are **California, New York, and Texas**, with California being the highest contributor.
- :white_check_mark: Comparative analysis shows higher monthly sales across most months in 2022, peaking in November and December.

## Final Strategy to Enhance Sales
- :dart: **Target Major States**: California, New York, and Texas account for a significant portion of sales. Enhancing promotions and customer engagement efforts in these states can drive further growth.
- :dart: **Leverage Technology and Office Supplies**: Both categories have seen strong sales, especially Technology, which accounts for the largest share of total sales. Targeted promotions and bundled offers for these categories may maximize profits.
- :dart: **Boost Sales in Low-Performing Months**: While November and December were peak months in both years, focusing on marketing during slower months (e.g., February, July) could help maintain steady sales growth throughout the year.
- :dart: **Capitalize on Profit Opportunities**: The **waterfall chart** for 2022 highlights significant profit gains, particularly in the Technology category. Strategic investment in inventory and marketing for high-profit products is crucial.
